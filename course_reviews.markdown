Spring 2025
- **15-150: Functional Programming**
  A recursion-heavy, "mathy" version of 15-122. Much cleaner. 
- **15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science**
  Fantastically taught class. Amazing TA's, textbook, lectures, you name it. 
- **15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems**
  Very enjoyable labs (minus proxy). 
- **21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations**
  Prof. Simone's teaching style made topics extremely understandable. A very solid linear algebra course. 
- **85-211: Cognitive Psychology**
  A low work gen ed that shared significant content with AP Psychology. Attendance not required, open-Google exams.

Fall 2024


- **15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation**
  The classic introduction to computer science at CMU. While there's already a lot of information about the course online, little has been shared about its new checkin system. The previously notorious midterms in this class have been replaced with 12+1 weekly quizzes, each covering one to two weeks worth of content. There are also weekly practice problems (worth a small amount of points to encourage students to complete them), and weekly programming assignments. I found the programming assignments fun and interesting applications of the course material, though it did always feel as if a 122 deadline was looming this semester (3 deadlines a week).
  Notable labs:
  images -- A lab where you "hide" images inside other images by modifying the least significant bits of each pixel. 
  strbuf -- A lab where you implement your own text editor from scratch. 
  huffman -- A lab where you implement huffman encodings. The last point of the assignment is gained by submitting your huffmna-encoded code to the autograder. 

- **21-127: Concepts of Mathematics**  
  This iteration of Concepts was taught by Clive Newstead (author of the course textbook), fantastic lecturer. 

- **76-101: Interpretation and Argument**
  Standard college writing. CMU does not accepts AP Lit or Lang credit. I did not enjoy this course, but to each their own.

- **99-101: Computing @ Carnegie Mellon**
  A tedious online course (about what, I couldn't tell you).
  
- **66-147: Mistrust in Research**
Almost entirely group based, aimed at having each group complete a literature review by the end of hte semeter. 
I have a distinct memory of the professors chuckling in class after handing out surprisingly harsh grades on the first of four large phases. I am yet to speak to anybody who enjoyed this course. 

- **80-100 - Introduction to Philosophy**
  An interesting and stimulating overview of the main ideas / contributors in the field of philosophy. This class consisted of a weekly reading, discussion, and writing assignment, with essays interspersed throughout the semeter. I particularly enjoyed the discussions and would recommend to anyone interested in philosophy.
