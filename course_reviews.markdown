Spring 2025
- **15-150: Functional Programming**
- **15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science**
- **15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems**
- **21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations**
  Prof. Simone's teaching style made topics extremely understandable. A very solid linear algebra course. 
- **85-211: Cognitive Psychology**
  A low work gen ed that shared significant content with AP Psychology. Attendance not required, open-Google exams.

Fall 2024


- **15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation**
  The classic introduction to computer science at CMU. While there's already a lot of information about the course online, little has been shared about its new checkin system. The previously notorious midterms in this class have been replaced with 12+1 weekly quizzes, each covering one to two weeks worth of content. The last few checkins were much harder than the rest, though not attending lecture likely did not help. I found the programming assignments fun and interesting applications of the course material, though it did always feel as if a 122 deadline was looming this semester (3 deadlines a week). 

- **21-127: Concepts of Mathematics**  
  Despite being taught by Clive Newstead (Author of the course textbook), this iteration of Concepts leaned slightly more towards a rote memorization class than a problem solving one. Would recommend trying to take 21-128 instead. 

- **76-101: Interpretation and Argument**
  Standard college writing. CMU does not take AP Lit or Lang. I did not enjoy this course, but to each their own.

- **99-101: Computing @ Carnegie Mellon**
  A tedious online course (about what, I couldn't tell you).
  
- **66-147: Mistrust in Research**
This class was entirely group based, aimed at having each group complete a literature review by the end of hte semeter. 
I have a distinct memory of the professors chuckling in class after handing out surprisingly harsh grades on the first of four large phases. I am yet to speak to anybody who enjoyed this class. 

- **80-100 - Introduction to Philosophy**
  An interesting and stimulating overview of the main ideas / contributors in the field of philosophy. This class consisted of a weekly reading, discussion, and writing assignment, with essays interspersed throughout the semeter. I enjoyed the discussions and would recommend to anyone remotely interested in the course material.
