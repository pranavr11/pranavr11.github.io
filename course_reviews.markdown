Spring 2025
- **15-150: Functional Programming**
  A recursion-heavy, "mathy" parallel to 15-122. Introduces the idea of functional programming -- a fundamentally different perspective on how one codes. Much cleaner than 15-122 and extremely enjoyable. Each homework assignment functions as a set of short puzzles, with elegant solutions usually 8-10 lines in length. 
- **15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science**
  Fantastically taught class. Amazing TAs, textbook, lectures, you name it. Despite being a 200-level CS Core, this functions as an intro course to the many aspects of theoretical computer science that one can study at CMU. Each week or two will introduce a new aspect of CS theory, building upon previous topics and a fundamental basis of problem solving. We covered graph theory, complexity theory, probability, and randomized algorithms, to name a few modules. The most fun course I've taken at CMU. 
- **15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems**
  Remember the interesting programming assignments from 122? What if there was no weekly test to study for, but instead more application of even more interesting content? Welcome to 213. Each week or two will see the release of a programming assignment based on the most recently taught systems topic. Everyone knows malloc lab -- but have you heard of BombLab, where you defuse a code "bomb" given purely the assembly that constructs it? Have you heard of AttackLab, where you literally hack another computer?

  A small portion of the points for each lab are dedicated to style. This forces you to be conscious about writing good comments and modular code.
  Overall a great course with very enjoyable labs (minus proxy). 
- **21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations**
  Prof. Simone's teaching style made topics extremely understandable. A very solid linear algebra course. 
- **85-211: Cognitive Psychology**
  An interesting and laid back gen ed that shared significant content with AP Psychology.

Fall 2024


- **15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation**
  The classic introduction to computer science at CMU. While there's already a lot of information about the course online, little has been shared about its new checkin system. The previously notorious midterms in this class have been replaced with 12+1 weekly quizzes, each covering one to two weeks worth of content. There are also weekly practice problems (worth a small amount of points to encourage students to complete them), and weekly programming assignments.
  The notion of "proving" correctness of your code is an interesting one -- taking this and Concepts together gave two very different but similar perspectives on what constituted a proof.
  I found the programming assignments fun and interesting applications of the course material, though it did always feel as if a 122 deadline was looming this semester (3 deadlines a week).
  Notable labs:
  images -- A lab where you "hide" images inside other images by modifying the least significant bits of each pixel. 
  strbuf -- A lab where you implement your own text editor from scratch. 
  huffman -- A lab where you implement huffman encodings. The last point of the assignment is gained by submitting your huffmna-encoded code to the autograder. 

- **21-127: Concepts of Mathematics**  
  This iteration of Concepts was taught by Clive Newstead (author of the course textbook), fantastic lecturer. I did not have much exposure to the course material in high scoool, so this course was a fun introduction to set and number theory. 

- **76-101: Interpretation and Argument**
  Standard college writing. 

- **99-101: Computing @ Carnegie Mellon**
  A tedious online course (about what, I couldn't tell you).
  
- **66-147: Mistrust in Research**
A group based course aimed at having each group complete a literature review by the end of the semeter.

- **80-100 - Introduction to Philosophy**
  An interesting and stimulating overview of the main ideas / contributors in the field of philosophy. This class consisted of a weekly reading, discussion, and writing assignment, with essays interspersed throughout the semeter. I particularly enjoyed the discussions and would recommend to anyone interested in philosophy.
